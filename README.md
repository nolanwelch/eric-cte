# Escape Room Integrated Coordinator

This is a program built by Nolan Welch for Chapel Thrill Escapes. The purpose of ERIC-CTE is to facilitate escape room bookings by doing the following:
1. Ensuring that participants booked as "on-campus students" have a valid PID
2. Notifying employees of bookings made during their shift
3. Alerting CTE administrators of any and all issues relating to bookings or employee scheduling
